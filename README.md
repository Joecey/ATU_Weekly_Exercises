# ATU Weekly Exercises
Done by yours truly - Joe Linogao âœ¨

## Context (last updated Jan 2024)
I started my Higher Diploma in Comp Sci at ATU (I know right, I finally decided to get a computer science degree). 
This will be the main repository I'll use to keep my weekly exercises in check. My other assignments will be placed elsewhere, so don't go looking for it here

`As a side note, I have no idea what java is used for. Will I figure that out? Who knows`

By the time 2025/2026 rolls around, three things might happen
* The world blows up due to all these conflicts in 2024
* I by some miracle get my comp sci degree
* I fail, drop out, and go back to ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ to become a farmer
